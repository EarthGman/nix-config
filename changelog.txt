add more mkDefault for more flexible configuration
change polybar default font size from 18 to 16
- i3lock:
now writes a script binary for the user's shell path instead of running a xdg config file.
binary called "i3lock" and will replace the default created by nixos option services.xserver.windowManager.i3.enable when run as a normal user
home-manager refactor:
  - rename minimal.nix to essentials.nix and is the default profile for home-manager. It contains many apps that are very useful and most profiles should import this
  - profiles are now required for each username and will contain important information shared between all of the users with that name on every machine (such as git email and username)
  these profiles can include some extra configuration under /hosts/hostname/users/username/preferences.nix that will be exclusive to that machine. (this file is no longer required)
