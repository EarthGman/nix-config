# may add some stuff here later
# 1. disable stylix themeing for fonts and cursors.
# - seems like plasma likes to take over alot so sometimes ill end up with 2 different cursors. One in apps and one the desktop.
# 2. If its possible automatically disable the gnome integration background process as it messes with the .gtkrc-2.0 and home-manager
